# my-own-cat-command
Have you ever wonder how cat works? I tried to figure it out!

## Prerequisites
To run this program on your terminal you'll need gcc compiler and make. You can install them on your system with any tutorial from Google. 

## But how do I run this?
Just run `make` in your terminal in the same directory where the makefile is located, and then run:
`./mi_cat diodos.txt`

Have fun! :D
